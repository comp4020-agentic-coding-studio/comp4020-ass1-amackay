  Metamath syntax summary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  The specification is found on pp. 111--114 of the
Metamath book.  The following syntax summary is provided for convenience
but may omit some details.

A Metamath database (set of one or more ASCII source files) is a sequence of
_tokens_, which are normally separated by spaces or line breaks.  The only
tokens that are built into the Metamath language are those (two-character
sequences) beginning with $, shown in the following. These tokens are called
_keywords_:

          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
  <label> $f ... $. - "Floating" hypothesis (i.e. variable type declaration)
  <label> $e ... $. - "Essential" hypothesis (i.e. a logical assumption for a
                      theorem or axiom)
  <label> $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
  <label> $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for defining the scope of the above statements
                      (except $a, $p which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $)
$(                  - Comments (may not be nested); see HELP LANGUAGE
                      for markup features.
          $[ ... $] - Include a file

The above two-character sequences beginning with "$" are the only primitives
built into the Metamath language.  The only "logic" Metamath uses in its proof
verification algorithm is the substitution of expressions for variables while
checking for distinct variable violations.  Everything else, including the
axioms for logic, is defined in this database file.

All other tokens are user-defined, and their names are arbitrary.  There are
two kinds of user-defined tokens, called math symbols (or just symbols) and
labels.  A _symbol_ may contain any non-whitespace printable character except
"$".  A _label_ may contain only alphanumeric characters and the characters "."
(period), "-" (hyphen), and "_" (underscore).  Symbols and labels are
case-sensitive.  All labels (except in proofs) must be distinct.  A label may
not have the same name as a symbol (to simplify the coding of certain parsers
and translators).

Here is some more detail about the syntax:

  $c <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols that
      haven't been used before.
  $v <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of distinct symbols that haven't been used yet
      in the current scope (see ${ ... $} below).
  $d <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols
      previously declared with $v in current scope.  It means that
      substitutions into these symbols may not have variables in common.
  <label> $f <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $e <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $a <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $p <symbollist> $= <proof> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.  <proof> is either a
      whitespace-delimited sequence of previous labels (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /NORMAL) or a compressed proof (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /COMPRESSED).  After using SAVE PROOF, use
      WRITE SOURCE to save the database file to disk.
  ${ ... $}
      Block for scoping the above statements (except $a, $p which are forever
      active).  Currently, $c may not occur inside of a block.
$)
  $( <any text> $)
$(    Comment.  Note: <any text> may not contain adjacent "$" and ")"
      characters.  The comment opening and closing delimiters must be
      surrounded by whitespace (space, tab, CR, LF, or FF).
  $[ <filename> $]
      Insert contents of <filename> at this point.  If <filename> is current
      file or has been already been inserted, it will not be inserted again.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents, also known as backticks
(` `). These tildes, tokens, math symbols and backticks should be surrounded by
spaces.  This way the LaTeX and HTML rendition of comments will be accurate,
and tools to globally change labels and math symbols will also change them in
comments.  Note that inside of backticks a pair of backticks is interpreted as
a single backtick.  A special comment containing $ t (with no space after the
dollar sign) defines LaTeX and HTML symbols.  See HELP LANGUAGE and HELP HTML
for other markup features in comments.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency.  The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in Appendix B of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be read by
humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF commands
described in the Metamath book (or the online HELP).

The Metamath program does not normally affect any content of this file other
than proofs, i.e., the text between "$=" and "$." (and some rewrapping).  All
other content is user-created.  Proofs are created or modified with the PROVE
command.

  Other notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1.  It is recommended that you be familiar with Chapters 2 and 4 of the
Metamath book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2, 3 and 5 explain
how to use the Metamath program.  Chapter 3 gives an informal overview of what
this source file is all about.  Appendix A gives the standard mathematical
symbols corresponding to some of the ASCII tokens used in this file.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation.  To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"C_" for "is a subset of".  The Metamath program "MM> HELP TEX" command
explains how to obtain a LaTeX output to see the real mathematical symbols.
Let us know if you have better suggestions for naming ASCII tokens.

2.  Theorems can be written in different forms, including "closed form",
"deduction form", and "inference form" (for details, see ~ conventions ).  For
basic theorems, all three forms are generally given, but for more advanced
theorems, we prefer to use the deduction form, since it permits to write proofs
in the "deduction style", and we do not add theorems in inference form unless
there are reasonable grounds for it (for instance, shortening sufficiently many
proofs to counterbalance their addition).

3.  On providing new definitions and theorems, the conventions provided in the
comment of ~ conventions should be obeyed.

4.  For a chronological list of changes to label names and label deletions, see
the changes-set.txt file.  This should help if you have a proof not checked
into the main repository and want to update it for recent changes.

###############################################################################
  CLASSICAL FIRST-ORDER LOGIC WITH EQUALITY
###############################################################################

  Logic can be defined as the "study of the principles of correct reasoning"
  (Merrilee H. Salmon's 1991 "Informal Reasoning and Informal Logic" in
  _Informal Reasoning and Education_) or as "a formal system using symbolic
  techniques and mathematical methods to establish truth-values" (the Oxford
  English Dictionary).

  This section formally defines the logic system we will use.  In particular,
  it defines symbols for declaring truthful statements, along with rules for
  deriving truthful statements from other truthful statements.  The system
  defined here is classical first-order logic (often abbreviated as FOL) with
  equality and no terms (the most common logic system used by mathematicians).

  We begin with a few housekeeping items in pre-logic, and then introduce
  propositional calculus (both its axioms and important theorems that can be
  derived from them).  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about
  well-formed formulas (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  This is
  followed by proofs that other axiomatizations of classical propositional
  calculus can be derived from the axioms we have chosen to use.

  We then define predicate calculus, which adds additional symbols and rules
  useful for discussing objects (beyond simply true or false).  In particular,
  it introduces the symbols ` = ` ("equals"), ` e. ` ("is a member of"), and
  ` A. ` ("for all").  The first two are called "predicates".  A predicate
  specifies a true or false relationship between its two arguments.

  Inferences for assisting proof development

       never appear in a completed proof.  They can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic; please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This inference says "if ` ph ` is true then ` ph ` is true".  This
       inference requires no axioms for its proof, and is useful as a
       copy-paste mechanism during proof development in mmj2.  It is normally
       not referenced in the final version of a proof, since it is always
       redundant.  You can remove this using the metamath-exe (Metamath
       program) Proof Assistant using the "MM-PA> MINIMIZE__WITH *" command.
       This is the inference associated with ~ id , hence its name.

    a1ii.2 $e |- ps $.
    $( (_Note_:  This inference rule and the previous one, ~ idi , will
       normally never appear in a completed proof.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The Metamath (Metamath-exe) program Proof Assistant requires proofs to
       be developed backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no
       mechanism that lets the user work on isolated subproofs.  This inference
       provides a workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any
       point in a proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the
       side, for later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:
       <HTML><ol><li>Assign this inference to any unknown step in the proof.
       Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       <code>MM-PA&gt; ASSIGN LAST</code> can be used.  This step will be
       replicated in hypothesis a1ii.1, from where the development of the main
       proof can continue.</li><li>Develop the independent subproof backwards
       from hypothesis a1ii.2.  If desired, use a
       <code>MM-PA&gt; LET STEP</code>
       command to pre-assign the conclusion of the independent subproof to
       a1ii.2.</li><li>After the independent subproof is complete, use
       <code>MM-PA&gt; IMPROVE ALL</code>
       to assign it automatically to an unknown
       step in the main proof that matches it.</li><li>After the entire proof
       is complete, use <code>MM-PA> MINIMIZE_WITH *</code> to clean up
       (discard) all ~ a1ii references automatically.</ol></HTML>

       This can also be used to apply subproofs from other theorems.  In step
       2, simply assign the theorem to a1ii.2, and run
       <HTML><code>MM-PA&gt; EXPAND &lt;theorem&gt;</code></HTML>
       to "import" a subproof
       from another theorem.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  It is the inference associated with ~ a1i .  (Contributed by
       NM, 7-Feb-2006.)  (Proof modification is discouraged.)

  Propositional calculus
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see Theorem ~ id ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at ~ mmbiblio.html
  for a complete cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the
  Metamath Proof Explorer.

  Recursively define primitive wffs for propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
$)

  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ".  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( Register negation '-.' as a primitive expression (lacking a
     definition). $)
  $( $j primitive 'wn'; $)

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ".  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input ` ph `
     connected through an inverter.  After we state the axioms of propositional
     calculus ( ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and ~ ax-mp ) and define the
     biconditional ( ~ df-bi ), the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ), and the
     constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth
     table values: ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truimtru ),
     ` ( ( T. -> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ truimfal ), ` ( ( F. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ falimtru ), and ` ( ( F. -> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falimfal ).  These
     have straightforward meanings, for example, ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     just means "the value of ` ( T. -> T. ) ` is ` T. ` ".

     The left-hand wff is called the antecedent, and the right-hand wff is
     called the consequent.  In the case of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the
     middle ` ps ` may be informally called either an antecedent or part of the
     consequent depending on context.  Contrast with ` <-> ` ( ~ df-bi ),
     ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), and ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ).

     This is called "material implication" and the arrow is usually read as
     "implies".  However, material implication is not identical to the meaning
     of "implies" in natural language.  For example, the word "implies" may
     suggest a causal relationship in natural language.  Material implication
     does not require any causal relationship.  Also, note that in material
     implication, if the consequent is true then the wff is always true (even
     if the antecedent is false).  Thus, if "implies" means material

     the wff is always true.  Thus, it is true that, "if the moon is made of
     green cheese that implies that 5=7" (because the moon is not actually made
     of green cheese).  A contradiction implies anything ( ~ pm2.21i ).  In

  The axioms of propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Propositional calculus (Axioms ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 and rule ~ ax-mp ) can
  be thought of as asserting formulas that are universally "true" when their
  variables are replaced by any combination of "true" and "false".
  Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege in 1879, using as his
  axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ pm2.04 ,
  ~ con3 , ~ notnot , and ~ notnotr .  Around 1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the
  system by eliminating the third (which follows from the first two, as you can
  see by looking at the proof of ~ pm2.04 ) and replacing the last three with
  our ~ ax-3 .  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this information.)

  The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
  Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
  true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we assign
  all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables and verify
  that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn ) always
  evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our approach is
  called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is derived from axioms.
  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for Propositional Calculus
  shows that the two approaches are equivalent and even provides an algorithm
  for automatically generating syntactic proofs from a truth table.  Those
  proofs, however, tend to be long, since truth tables grow exponentially with
  the number of variables, and the much shorter proofs that we show here were
  found manually.

    $( Rule of Modus Ponens.  The postulated inference rule of propositional
       calculus.  See, e.g., Rule 1 of [Hamilton] p. 73.  The rule says, "if
       ` ph ` is true, and ` ph ` implies ` ps ` , then ` ps ` must also be
       true".  This rule is sometimes called "detachment", since it detaches
       the minor premise from the major premise.  "Modus ponens" is short for
       "modus ponendo ponens", a Latin phrase that means "the mode that by
       affirming affirms" - remark in [Sanford] p. 39.  This rule is similar to
       the rule of modus tollens ~ mto .

       Note:  In some web page displays such as the Statement List, the
       symbols " ` & ` " and " ` => ` " informally indicate the relationship
       between the hypotheses and the assertion (conclusion), abbreviating the
       English words "and" and "implies".  They are not part of the formal
       language.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)

     [Hamilton] p. 28.  This axiom is called _Simp_ or "the principle of
     simplification" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because "it enables us to pass from the joint
     assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply".  It is
     Proposition 1 of [Frege1879] p. 26, its first axiom.  (Contributed by NM,

  $( Axiom _Frege_.  Axiom A2 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of

     consequents.  This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known
     as _Frege_ in the literature; see Proposition 2 of [Frege1879] p. 26.  It
     is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other
     direction of this axiom also turns out to be true, as demonstrated by
     ~ pm5.41 .  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.) $)

  $( Axiom _Transp_.  Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
     propositional calculus.  It swaps or "transposes" the order of the
     consequents when negation is removed.  An informal example is that the
     statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
     the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky".  This axiom
     is called _Transp_ or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia
     Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also
     use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is
     advised that in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a
     different technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Sep-1992.)  Use its
     alias ~ con4 instead.  (New usage is discouraged.) $)

  so are intuitionistic.  The system { ~ ax-mp , ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 } axiomatizes
  what is sometimes called "intuitionistic implicational calculus" or "minimal

  In an implication, the wff before the arrow is called the "antecedent" and
  the wff after the arrow is called the "consequent".

  Logical equivalence
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Definition ~ df-bi in this section is our first definition, which
  introduces and defines the biconditional connective ` <-> ` used to denote
  logical equivalence.  We define a wff of the form ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an
  abbreviation for ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

  Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a separate
  symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as".  Instead, we will later use the
  biconditional connective for this purpose ( ~ df-an is its first use), as it
  allows to use logic to manipulate definitions directly.  This greatly
  simplifies many proofs since it eliminates the need for a separate mechanism
  for introducing and eliminating definitions.

  A note on definitions: definitions are required to be eliminable (that is, a
  theorem stated in terms of the defined symbol can also be stated without it)
  and conservative (that is, a theorem whose statement does not contain the
  defined symbol can be proved without using that definition).  This means that
  a definition does not increase the expressive power nor the deductive power,
  respectively, of a theory.  On the other hand, definitions are often useful
  to write shorter proofs, so in (i)set.mm we will generally not try to avoid
  them.  This is why, for instance, some theorems which do not contain
  disjunction in their statement are placed after the section on disjunction
  because a shorter proof using disjunction is possible.

     This greatly simplifies many proofs since it eliminates the need for a
     separate mechanism for introducing and eliminating definitions.  Of
     course, we cannot use this mechanism to define the biconditional itself,
     since it hasn't been introduced yet.  Instead, we use a more general form
     of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the
     defining expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the
     previously proved theorem ~ bijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to
     prove any statement expressed in the original language that can't be
     proved from the original axioms, because if we simply replace each
     instance of ~ df-bi in the proof with the corresponding ~ bijust instance,
     we will end up with a proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are not strengthening the language.  To indicate this
     fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just a naming convention for human readability.)

     After we define the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant
     false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth table
     values: ` ( ( T. <-> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ trubitru ),
     ` ( ( T. <-> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ trubifal ), ` ( ( F. <-> T. ) <-> F. ) `
     ( ~ falbitru ), and ` ( ( F. <-> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falbifal ).

     See ~ dfbi1 , ~ dfbi2 , and ~ dfbi3 for theorems suggesting typical
     textbook definitions of ` <-> ` , showing that our definition has the
     properties we expect.  Theorem ~ dfbi1 is particularly useful if we want
     to eliminate ` <-> ` from an expression to convert it to primitives.
     Theorem ~ dfbi shows this definition rewritten in an abbreviated form
     after conjunction is introduced, for easier understanding.

     Contrast with ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ ` ( ~ df-nan ),
     and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ).  In some sense ` <-> ` returns true if two truth
     values are equal; ` = ` ( ~ df-cleq ) returns true if two classes are
     equal.  (Contributed by NM, 27-Dec-1992.) $)

  $( Alternate proof of ~ dfbi1 .  This proof, discovered by Gregory Bush on

     directly from the axioms and ~ df-bi , compared to over 800 steps were the
     proof of ~ dfbi1 expanded into axioms.  Second, step 2 demands only the
     property of "true"; any axiom (or theorem) could be used.  It might be
     thought, therefore, that it is in some sense redundant, but in fact no
     proof is shorter than this (measured by number of steps).  Third, it
     illustrates how intermediate steps can "blow up" in size even in short
     proofs.  Fourth, the compressed proof is only 182 bytes (or 17 bytes in
     D-proof notation), but the generated web page is over 200kB with
     intermediate steps that are essentially incomprehensible to humans (other
     than Gregory Bush).  If there were an obfuscated code contest for proofs,
     this would be a contender.  This "blowing up" and incomprehensibility of
     the intermediate steps vividly demonstrate the advantages of using many
     layered intermediate theorems, since each theorem is easier to understand.

  Logical conjunction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section defines conjunction of two formulas, denoted by infix " ` /\ ` "
  and read "and".  It is defined in terms of implication and negation, which is
  possible in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm).

  After the definition, we briefly introduce conversion of simple expressions
  to and from conjunction.  Two simple operations called importation ( ~ imp )
  and exportation ( ~ ex ) follow.  In the propositions-as-types
  interpretation, they correspond to uncurrying and currying respectively. They
  are foundational for this section.  Most of the theorems proved here trace
  back to them, mostly indirectly, in a layered fashion, where more complex
  expressions are built from simpler ones.  Here are some of these successive
  layers:
  importation and exportation,
  commutativity and associativity laws,
  adding antecedents and simplifying,
  conjunction of consequents,
  syllogisms,
  etc.

  As indicated in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, some theorems containing only implication, negation and
  conjunction are placed in the section after disjunction since theirs proofs
  use disjunction (although this is not required since definitions are
  conservative, see said section comment).

$)

  $( Declare connective for conjunction ("and"). $)
  $c /\ $.  $( Wedge (read:  "and") $)

  $( Extend wff definition to include conjunction ("and"). $)
  wa $a wff ( ph /\ ps ) $.

  $( Define conjunction (logical "and").  Definition of [Margaris] p. 49.  When
     both the left and right operand are true, the result is true; when either
     is false, the result is false.  For example, it is true that
     ` ( 2 = 2 /\ 3 = 3 ) ` .  After we define the constant true ` T. `
     ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able
     to prove these truth table values: ` ( ( T. /\ T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ truantru ), ` ( ( T. /\ F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ truanfal ),
     ` ( ( F. /\ T. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ falantru ), and
     ` ( ( F. /\ F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ falanfal ).

     This is our first use of the biconditional connective in a definition; we
     use the biconditional connective in place of the traditional "<=def=>",
     which means the same thing, except that we can manipulate the
     biconditional connective directly in proofs rather than having to rely on
     an informal definition substitution rule.  Note that if we mechanically
     substitute ` -. ( ph -> -. ps ) ` for ` ( ph /\ ps ) ` , we end up with an
     instance of previously proved theorem ~ biid .  This is the justification
     for the definition, along with the fact that it introduces a new symbol
     ` /\ ` .  Contrast with ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ `
     ( ~ df-nan ), and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ).  (Contributed by NM,

  Logical disjunction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section defines disjunction of two formulas, denoted by infix " ` \/ ` "
  and read "or".  It is defined in terms of implication and negation, which is
  possible in classical logic (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm).
  This section contains only theorems proved without ~ df-an (theorems that are
  proved using ~ df-an are deferred to the next section).  Basic theorems that
  help simplifying and applying disjunction are ~ olc , ~ orc , and ~ orcom .

  As mentioned in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, all theorems in this and the previous section can be stated in
  terms of implication and negation only.  Additionally, in classical logic
  (but not in intuitionistic logic: see iset.mm), it is also possible to
  translate conjunction into disjunction and conversely via the De Morgan law
  ~ anor : conjunction and disjunction are dual connectives.  Either is
  sufficient to develop all propositional calculus of the logic (together with
  implication and negation).  In practice, conjunction is more efficient, its
  big advantage being the possibility to use it to group antecedents in a
  convenient way, using ~ imp and ~ ex as noted in the previous section.

  An illustration of the conservativity of ~ df-an is given by ~ orim12dALT ,
  which is an alternate proof of ~ orim12d not using ~ df-an .

     when both sides are false, the result is false.  For example, it is true
     that ` ( 2 = 3 \/ 4 = 4 ) ` ( ~ ex-or ).  After we define the constant
     true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we
     will be able to prove these truth table values:

  Mixed connectives
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This section gathers theorems of propositional calculus which use (either in
  their statement or proof) mixed connectives (at least conjunction and
  disjunction).

  As noted in the "note on definitions" in the section comment for logical
  equivalence, some theorem statements may contain for instance only
  conjunction or only disjunction, but both definitions are used in their
  proofs to make them shorter (this is exemplified in ~ orim12d versus
  ~ orim12dALT ).  These theorems are mostly grouped at the beginning of this
  section.

  The family of theorems starting with ~ animorl focus on the relation between
  conjunction and disjunction and can be seen as the starting point of mixed
  connectives in statements.  This sectioning is not rigorously true, since for
  instance the section begins with ~ jaao and related theorems.

  The conditional operator for propositions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This subsection introduces the conditional operator for propositions, denoted
  by ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` (see ~ df-ifp ).  It is the analogue for
  propositions of the conditional operator for classes, denoted by
  ` if ( ph , A , B ) ` (see ~ df-if ).

$)

  $( Comma.  Also used later for adders, pairs, tuples, etc. $)
  $c , $.

  $( Symbol for the conditional operator for propositions. $)
  $c if- $.

  $( Extend wff notation to include the conditional operator for
     propositions. $)
  wif $a wff if- ( ph , ps , ch ) $.

  $( Definition of the conditional operator for propositions.  The expression
     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` is read "if ` ph ` then ` ps ` else ` ch ` ".
     See ~ dfifp2 , ~ dfifp3 , ~ dfifp4 , ~ dfifp5 , ~ dfifp6 and ~ dfifp7 for
     alternate definitions.

     This definition (in the form of ~ dfifp2 ) appears in Section II.24 of
     [Church] p. 129 (Definition D12 page 132), where it is called "conditioned
     disjunction".  Church's ` [ ps , ph , ch ] ` corresponds to our
     ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` (note the permutation of the first two
     variables).

     This form was chosen as the definition rather than ~ dfifp2 for
     compatibility with intuitionistic logic development: with this form, it is
     clear that ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` implies decidability of ` ph ` , which
     is most often what is wanted.

     Church uses the conditional operator as an intermediate step to prove
     completeness of some systems of connectives.  The first result is that the
     system ` { if- , T. , F. } ` is complete: for the induction step, consider
     a formula of n+1 variables; single out one variable, say ` ph ` ; when one
     sets ` ph ` to True (resp.  False), then what remains is a formula of n
     variables, so by the induction hypothesis it is equivalent to a formula
     using only the connectives ` if- , T. , F. ` , say ` ps ` (resp. ` ch ` );
     therefore, the formula ` if- ( ph , ps , ch ) ` is equivalent to the
     initial formula of n+1 variables.  Now, since ` { -> , -. } ` and similar
     systems suffice to express the connectives ` if- , T. , F. ` , they are
     also complete.

     ambiguity with other uses of the vertical bar.  In the second edition of
     Principia Mathematica (1927), Russell and Whitehead used the Sheffer
     stroke and suggested it as a replacement for the "or" and "not" operations
     of the first edition.  However, in practice, "or" and "not" are more
     widely used.  After we define the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and

       not "overload" the ` = ` connective with two syntax definitions.  This
       is done to prevent ambiguity that would complicate some Metamath
       parsers.  For example, some parsers - although not the Metamath program
       - stumble on the fact that the ` = ` in ` x = y ` could be the ` = ` of
       either ~ weq or ~ wceq , although mathematically it makes no difference.
       The class variables ` A ` and ` B ` are introduced temporarily for the
       purpose of this definition but otherwise not used in predicate calculus.

  Half adder and full adder in propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Propositional calculus deals with truth values, which can be interpreted as
  bits.  Using this, we can define the half adder and the full adder in pure
  propositional calculus, and show their basic properties.

  The half adder adds two 1-bit numbers.  Its two outputs are the "sum" S and
  the "carry" C.  The real sum is then given by 2C+S.  The sum and carry
  correspond respectively to the logical exclusive disjunction ( ~ df-xor ) and
  the logical conjunction ( ~ df-an ).

  The full adder takes into account an "input carry", so it has three inputs
  and again two outputs, corresponding to the "sum" ( ~ df-had ) and "updated
  carry" ( ~ df-cad ).

  Here is a short description.  We code the bit 0 by ` F. ` and 1 by ` T. ` .
  Even though ` hadd ` and ` cadd ` are invariant under permutation of their
  arguments, assume for the sake of concreteness that ` ph ` (resp. ` ps ` ) is
  the i^th bit of the first (resp. second) number to add (with the convention
  that the i^th bit is the multiple of 2^i in the base-2 representation), and
  that ` ch ` is the i^th carry (with the convention that the 0^th carry is 0).
  Then, ` hadd ( ph , ps , ch ) ` gives the i^th bit of the sum, and
  ` cadd ( ph , ps , ch ) ` gives the (i+1)^th carry.  Then, addition is
  performed by iteration from i = 0 to i = 1 + (max of the number of digits of
  the two summands) by "updating" the carry.

  Minimal implicational calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Minimal implicational calculus, or intuitionistic implicational calculus, or
  positive implicational calculus, is the implicational fragment of minimal
  calculus (which is also the implicational fragment of intuitionistic calculus
  and of positive calculus).  It is sometimes called "C-pure intuitionism"
  since the letter C is sometimes used to denote implication, especially in
  prefix notation.  It can be axiomatized by the inference rule of modus ponens
  ~ ax-mp together with the axioms { ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 } (sometimes written KS),
  or with { ~ imim1 , ~ ax-1 , ~ pm2.43 } (written B'KW), or with { ~ imim2 ,
  ~ pm2.04 , ~ ax-1 , ~ pm2.43 } (written BCKW), or with the single axiom
  ~ minimp .  This section proves ~ minimp from { ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 }, and then
  the converse, due to Ivo Thomas.

  Sources for this section are the webpage

  C. A. Meredith, A. N. Prior,
  _Notes on the axiomatics of the propositional calculus_,
  Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, vol. 4 (1963), 171--187.

  We may use a compact notation for derivations known as the D-notation where
  "D" stands for "condensed Detachment".  For instance, "D21" means detaching
  ~ ax-1 from ~ ax-2 , that is, using modus ponens ~ ax-mp with ~ ax-1 as minor
  premise and ~ ax-2 as major premise.  D-strings are accepted by the grammar
  Dstr := digit | "D" Dstr Dstr.

  Implicational Calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Implicational calculus is the fragment of propositional logic that uses only
  material implication, and not negation.  It can be axiomatized by inference
  rule modus ponens ~ ax-mp together with the axioms { ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 ,
  ~ peirce } or the Tarski-Bernays axioms { ~ ax-1 , ~ imim1 , ~ peirce } or
  with the single axiom { ~ impsingle }.  From either one of these three axiom
  sets, all tautologies containing only material implication may be proved.  In
  contrast, minimal implicational calculus, which is presented just before this
  section, cannot prove certain tautologies ( ~ peirce , for example ).  The
  class of theorems proved by minimal implicational calculus is thus a subset
  of the class of theorems proved by implicational calculus.

  The primary source for this section is the paper by Jan Lukasiewicz, _The
  Shortest Axiom of the Implicational Calculus of Propositions_, Proceedings
  of the Royal Irish Academy, Section A, vol. 52 (1948-1950), 25--33.  It will

  $( Carew Meredith's sole axiom for propositional calculus.  This amazing
     formula is thought to be the shortest possible single axiom for
     propositional calculus with inference rule ~ ax-mp , where negation and
     implication are primitive.  Here we prove Meredith's axiom from ~ ax-1 ,
     ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-3 .  Then from it we derive the Lukasiewicz axioms
     ~ luk-1 , ~ luk-2 , and ~ luk-3 .  Using these we finally rederive our
     axioms as ~ ax1 , ~ ax2 , and ~ ax3 , thus proving the equivalence of all
     three systems.  C. A. Meredith, "Single Axioms for the Systems (C,N),
     (C,O) and (A,N) of the Two-Valued Propositional Calculus", _The Journal of
     Computing Systems_ vol. 1 (1953), pp. 155-164.  Meredith claimed to be
     close to a proof that this axiom is the shortest possible, but the proof
     was apparently never completed.

     An obscure Irish lecturer, Meredith (1904-1976) became enamored with logic
     somewhat late in life after attending talks by Lukasiewicz and produced
     many remarkable results such as this axiom.  From his obituary:  "He did
     logic whenever time and opportunity presented themselves, and he did it on
     whatever materials came to hand: in a pub, his favored pint of porter
     within reach, he would use the inside of cigarette packs to write proofs
     for logical colleagues."  (Contributed by NM, 14-Dec-2002.)  (Proof

  Stoic logic non-modal portion (Chrysippus of Soli)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic called Stoic logic.  The Stoic
  Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest logicians
  of antiquity.  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it
  focuses on propositional logic, though later thinkers did combine the systems
  of the Stoics with Aristotle.  Jan Lukasiewicz reports, "For anybody familiar
  with mathematical logic it is self-evident that the Stoic dialectic is the
  ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic,
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).

  In this section we show that the propositional logic system we use (which is
  non-modal) is at least as strong as the non-modal portion of Stoic logic.  We
  show this by showing that our system assumes or proves all of key features of
  Stoic logic's non-modal portion (specifically the Stoic logic
  indemonstrables, themata, and principles).

  "In terms of contemporary logic, Stoic syllogistic is best understood as a
  substructural backwards-working Gentzen-style natural-deduction system that
  consists of five kinds of axiomatic arguments (the indemonstrables) and four
  inference rules, called themata.  An argument is a syllogism precisely if it
  either is an indemonstrable or can be reduced to one by means of the themata
  (Diogenes Laertius (D. L. 7.78))." (_Ancient Logic_, Stanford Encyclopedia of
  Philosophy ~ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ).  There are
  also a few "principles" that support logical reasoning, discussed below.  For
  more information, see "Stoic Logic" by Susanne Bobzien, especially
  [Bobzien] p. 110-120, especially for a discussion about the themata
  (including how they were reconstructed and how they were used).  There are
  differences in the systems we can only partly represent, for example, in
  Stoic logic "truth and falsehood are temporal properties of assertibles...
  They can belong to an assertible at one time but not at another"
  ([Bobzien] p. 87).  Stoic logic also included various kinds of modalities,
  which we do not include here since our basic propositional logic does not
  include modalities.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in general it is
  difficult to assign specific ideas to specific thinkers.  The indemonstrables
  are described in, for example, [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and
  [Hitchcock] p. 5.  These indemonstrables are modus ponendo ponens (modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp , modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto , modus
  ponendo tollens I ~ mptnan , modus ponendo tollens II ~ mptxor , and modus
  tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtpxor .  The first is an axiom, the
  second is already proved; in this section we prove the other three.  Note
  that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtpxor originally used exclusive-or, but over
  time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred to an
  inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtpor .

  After we prove the indemonstratables, we then prove all the Stoic logic
  themata (the inference rules of Stoic logic; "thema" is singular).  This is
  straightforward for thema 1 ( ~ stoic1a and ~ stoic1b ) and thema 3
  ( ~ stoic3 ).  However, while Stoic logic was once a leading logic system,
  most direct information about Stoic logic has since been lost, including the
  exact texts of thema 2 and thema 4.  There are, however, enough references
  and specific examples to support reconstruction.  Themata 2 and 4 have been
  reconstructed; see statements T2 and T4 in [Bobzien] p. 110-120 and our
  proofs of them in ~ stoic2a , ~ stoic2b , ~ stoic4a , and ~ stoic4b .

  Stoic logic also had a set of principles involving assertibles.  Statements
  in [Bobzien] p. 99 express the known principles.  The following paragraphs
  discuss these principles and our proofs of them.

  "A principle of double negation, expressed by saying that a double-negation
  (Not: not: p) is equivalent to the assertible that is doubly negated (p) (DL
  VII 69)."  In other words, ` ( ph <-> -. -. ph ) ` as proven in ~ notnotb .

  "The principle that all conditionals that are formed by using the same
  assertible twice (like 'If p, p') are true (Cic. Acad. II 98)."  In other
  words, ` ( ph -> ph ) ` as proven in ~ id .

  "The principle that all disjunctions formed by a contradiction (like 'Either
  p or not: p') are true (S. E. M VIII 282)."  Remember that in Stoic logic,
  'or' means 'exclusive or'.  In other words, ` ( ph \/_ -. ph ) ` as proven in
  ~ xorexmid .

  [Bobzien] p. 99 also suggests that Stoic logic may have dealt with
  commutativity (see ~ xorcom and ~ ancom ) and the principle of contraposition
  ( ~ con4 ) (pointing to DL VII 194).

  In short, the non-modal propositional logic system we use is at least as
  strong as the non-modal portion of Stoic logic.

  For more about Aristotle's system, see ~ barbara and related theorems.
